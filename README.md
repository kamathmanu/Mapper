# Mapper
A mapping system analogous to Google Maps I made with two other team members as part of a design course in my 2nd year. 

Note: this project was done from January - April 2017, using SVN as a version control. I don't have the SVN repo with me, so this is just an upload of the files. These were roughly my contributions:

1) Built and used data structures (arrays, hashmaps) for efficient querying of map data.
2) Contributed to rendering the map data using EasyGL (OpenGL-like variant for newbies)
3) Built the GUI that acceped user input and mapped it to the corresponding map data. Implemented fuzzy search for search bar autocompletion.
4) 2-opt solution for Travelling Salesman Problem variant (VRPPD).
